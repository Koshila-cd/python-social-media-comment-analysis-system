Movie-reviews
I think I'm into the movie
good movie but stupid ending
When will this be on Netflix?
What is so freaking special about this movie i'm so confused?! Well at least it's not about doing a fish so i guess anything's better than that...
This movie is so fucking good. It had me crying like a baby at the end. 😭😭
This movie is really break my heart in a good way
I watched it tonight and I cried.
"Seems like a good movie, is it out yet?"
What is this even about?? The fff
Looking forward to seeing this!
"I live just east of Sacramento, and I'm parked across the street from the big blue house that appears in this movie right now. There's a little red carpet rolled down the walkway that leads to the house's front door. People walk by to take photos. I've not seen this film yet, and probably won't. Sacramento is not the worst."
"""How did I raise such a snob"".....I want to see this movie."
Just don't...
"I saw it last night, what's the fuss about? Very flat, disappointing all around. A coming of age story with no edge to it.... Nothing special at all."
The trailer did not do this film any justice. I was surprised by how emotional this movie made me. Well done.
"We all know what’s going to win. To shut the sjws up, it’ll be Get Out."
The trailer doesn't do justice to this brilliant film. The tone Gerwig's direction brought to this story was brilliant!
What a boring movie..just a waste of time...Hollywood gets shittier
Sucks
This movie got me so emotional. One the best movies I've ever seen
Hey Sheldon mother.....l am not crazy my other is me tested....
Trailer is the best of a not very good film.
i love this omgggg <33333
I just watched it today and it's very funny
no thank you to see almost 2 hourr an histerical young lady
"Sadly, a film about nothing. Totally forgettable. On the other hand, 3 Billboards...unmissable."
Does anyone know what The name of the piano song that plays in The beginning?
trash asf
yep... looks yucky
I just watched it and I regret it
WANNA WAAAATCH SO BADLY
<3 !
Loved it!
I feel bad for a generation who actually are into garbage movies like this and shows how pathetic the whole movies are getting that shit like this gets to be an Oscar nominee
"How did a movie like this get rated so good, just seen it in Ireland and was not impressed at all, big hype up for nothing. Would be a good movie if you were doing a state exam to analysis different emotions which was pretty depressing a lot of the time."
Omg it’s Christian from dance academy
I'm sorry.. i just watched this movie and nothing fucking happens the entire time. What was the point of this film?
"I just saw this movie it was a masterpiece but can somebody who’s seen the movie tell me what was wrong with the priest who was the musical director...there was that scene where he was at the doctor and she was like how long have you been feeling this way? And asking if he has support, what was going on?"
My favorite movie of the year so far and Jonah Hill was excellent!
It's like Bollywood movie Simran !!
"there is almost nothing i dont relate to in her character, favorite movie 2018 and i havent even watched it"
I saw the movie and i think it's way too overated
Well how original ... a film about a spoiled ungrateful attention seeking brat ? That has never happened before!
THIS MOVIE IS SHIT!!! IM GONNA PUKE!!!
I've just watched this movie and it was beautiful!
no thank you :)
"What scares me is that she's academically good.
Shit"
"she made one bad decision in 19
two bad decisions"
tim babyyyyyy i love you
this movie reminds me of the movie PIECES OF APRIL. like if the movie lady bird is telling the story of how it was before...
She looks too old to be playing a 17 year old. Just checked she is nearly 24. LOL.
can someone suggest me any recommendations with this kind of movie? film? anyone?
the end o f this movie was like...huh?..thats it?
😍😍😍😍
"this represents the assholism of new age girls. this character will accuse everyone of sexual harassment at the age 30-40+, write some shitty books about nonsense no one cares about, self-centered mindset will prevent her to grow as a human being, let alone adopt any knowledge. Yep, future shrieking left winger nobody."
is this a nice movie or not?
I'm in love with every single second of this
i wonder if sheldons mom sang soft kitty to her after she jumped out of the car..hehe
This and end of the fucking world on Netflix my two favs ....
I wanna see this so bad where can I find it!!!!
"I'm not yelling
Owww its perfect"
I Hate trailers.
she reminds me of chloe from life is stange
Omg she did the same thing Steve Carrell did in Crazy Stupid Love
Bitches gonna love this movie
songs of this trailer please?
Best movie of all time 💓
"I have not seen this movie, but based on reading the plot and watching this trailer it reminds me so much of the 1999 film ""Anywhere But Here,"" which stars Susan Sarandon and Natalie Portman."
I'm already in love with this movie
what music is playing in the first part of the trailer?
She needs to shut up and make me a sandwich
I thought movies were to tell a story.
"It's not going to be popular, but I have to ask: Where is the father?"
"Next generation....No head,no brain,no....."
another boring A24 movie
Gonna watch this tomorrow. I feel like it will be a good one. :)
I can't think of that dude without thinking about 'call me by your name'
my dream is to have a girl like this
this looks awesome
i like that galway girl.
LOVE IT (just watched it).
love this film so much.
see you there!
"omg this movie sums up my relationship with my mom it's exactly the same. what is also funny is that me and mom went to watch the movie and on our way their we got into a fight so we didn't sit next to each other at cinema, and she would look at me the whole time the mom says anything to her daughter. it was emotional to me lol"
Im sooooo pumped for this movie!
This movie was fucking ass.
best. trailer. yet. im in tears
"This movie was good, but the ending was like the producers ran out of time and ended it abruptly."
BEST MOVIE EVER

BEST MOVIE EVER
I've watched it. It's a so so movie but the story is really relatable and that's why I loved it.
The movie is way better than the trailer
so boring
Where can i watch this?
what a lame movie..
I love this fucking movie
I'll pass
who also thinks that this movie is average?
Why is there so much whispering in this moving? TALK normal ffs!
Deep movie
This movie is so ducking good
Finally....a movie that gives due justice to the Catholic Church.
This is such a good movie and has a great storyline!
Is that the girl who played in lovely bones ??
White people movies...zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz.
Timmmmmmyyyy
Nominated for best picture??????
nominate this
This movie is so overrated. I hope it doesn't win any Oscars
This is the kind of movie I couldn’t watch in the theaters but would watch at least twice on netflix
Looks overrated
This doesn’t deserve an Oscar
another stupid teenager movie
Oscar nominee for best movie 🎥 👏🏻
i think iTonya is way better
"I love this movie because it's so realistic. How many movies portray a character who attends Catholic school, grew up in a small house and shops at thrift stores? This was my life as a teenager."
An absolutely amazing movie
Trevor 💙
amazing. i’ve seen it 4 times
"When she says "" what if this is the best version?"" I feel like I am watching myself say those words."
I’ve seen this trailer 20 times
"I wanna hug ""Lady Bird"", ""Lady Bird"" needs a hug."
"I want to see this movie so bad, but I am afraid it will make me realize stuff."
This is the whitest thing I’ve ever seen
It's insane that she can do this accent so well
Shitty dating material
No one is going to talk about Sheldon's mom? Okayy!
"definitely seems like she went to my school- all girls, the uniform, catholic. god help her"
"call me by your name and i'll call you by mine... 
Lady Bird, Lady Bird, Lady Bird..."
I LOVE Saoirse Ronan Especially the lovely bones one
Lucas Hedges is in a lot of great movies lately. He was in Manchester By The Sea and I just saw Three Billboards Outside Ebbing Missouri (GREAT FUCKING MOVIE) that he was in and now Lady Bird. I haven't seen Lady Bird yet but it's getting tons of praise.
I loved this. Gave me such a good needed cry and many laughs. <3 xxx
i decided to watch this movie when she jumped off the moving car
Can anyone tell me the name of the song that they played while “Kyle’s” band was performing?
"This was such a beautiful movie. I went to see it with my best friend, who has a different taste in films but we laughed and cried together. Sometimes we felt like we were watching scenes from our lives. Great movie!"
"This movie is beautiful, is not your typical teen drama, its really emotional, and REAL, its just..beautiful"
lame
I love it! 👏🏻👌🏻❤️
I didn't know my life as a fourteen year old was made into a movie
Another indie movie
"To be honest with this film, I believe that this production shouldn't have won best motion picture at the 2018 golden globe awards. I believe and I quote myself that 'The Greatest Showman' had a way more better chance of winning the award then all the other selected nominees. Just putting it out there!
P.S. Sorry if i offended anyone and I don't mean to put down the director of this film, Mrs Greta Gerwig. Your work is a complete masterpiece."
Can anyone tell me the song that was playing in background when lady bird and danny were dancing? if anyone watched movie please let me know.
the guy looks much younger than the girl and they are supposed to be college mates...
This movie is my teenage hood lol and no joke I wore a pink cast just like that
I've seen way better Indie films. I don't get what all of the raves are about this movie. I didn't like it at all.
This looks outstanding! Already know I'm going to watch this film multiple times. I keep watching the trailer again and again... Best acting all round...Laurie Metcalf is a legend
What this movie did was very baller.
"I know it's probably a great movie, but the trailer makes it looks like I try hard, pretentious, cheesy movie that will just fade into oblivion."
yawn
Why this kind of movie aways have a shit end?
is the bass song in the middle the same song kyle’s band played?? is it an actual song?
"This review from IMDB sums it up perfectly:

A trite, masturbatory piece tailored towards middle aged cat ladies and those on the path to becoming one. The drama, despite being filled with talent, lacked any semblance of depth, and could easily be likened to a comedy when you begin to view it in its proper context. It is essentially an incredibly mediocre male coming-of-age tale, but with the genders reversed.

""Lady Bird"" is the projection of what third wave feminists (for some reason) wish women were. She is the emotional pillar for those around her; she is stoic, bold, confrontational, daring, and always the first one to initiate romantic advancements. In other words, she is a caricature of masculine virtues and behavior, but as a *17 year old girl*. In the few places where she is found to be emotionally lacking, her parental counterpart (whose character is infinitely more believable by virtue of her background and hormonal makeup) steps in to fill the shoes (and/or pants). In accordance with this narrative, the men in lead roles have seemingly been injected with soy from birth. Soft-featured incompetent doughboys who lack the agency to engage life, functioning instead as submissive basket-cases, vectors through which Lady Bird asserts her outright dominance and emotional stoicism.

That's the catch. That's the novelty driving this movies popularity (besides decent acting), a young girl who acts like a man. How risqué, how compelling. The screenwriters and director should really give themselves a pat on the back for this one.

Anyway, there's certainly more to be said of the social agenda etched into every corner of this films script, but I've not the time nor the patience to spend another minute of my life on this trash. It is completely incongruent with reality, and therefore unrelatable to anyone who isn't living vicariously through the protagonist.

The only redeeming factor of the film was the degree to which this absurd gender reversal dynamic managed to add a veneer of comedy to virtually everything that took place (especially the ""serious"" scenes)."
IS THAT FUCKING CHRISTIAN FROM DANCE ACADEMY WTFFFF
solitaire
this movie sucked ass
WHAT SONG PLAYED AT THE END???
Amazing film! Won Golden Globe Best Picture for Musical or Comedy.
Looks kinda lame.
wauw this is some boring shit
is this on netflix?
Lovely Bones star.. <3
"Hot garbage.
Dumpster. Fire."
ONLY WHITE PEOPLE WILL LIKE THIS MOVIE
IT WAS AMAZING EVERYONE GO WATCH IT RN
Looks so good!
She's gonna win the Oscar.
This looks boring as f**k.
What is the Problem?
A Masterpiece.
No desire to see this.
Who is here after golden globes award 😁
Such a good movie!!
great movie.I really suggest it
oscars is hers sooner or later
This is gonna be complete trash.
"too bad 
as we go along didnt make the soundtrack either"
Well I made it to 17 seconds
na. pass
this movie is trash
DOES ANYONE KNOW THE NAME OF THE SONG THAT THE BAND PLAYED IN THE COFFEE SHOP SCENE?!!!?!?!?!?!?!?!
"She's always been a damn good actor. 
Ever since Hannah. But. Its a shame nobody cares
about her movies."
no
"This movie goes very fast. She reminds you of Lohan, alot. It has ALL kinds of people in the movie...mean friends, nice friends, honest friends, dishonest friends...most the non-student(adults) are depressed and the kids are cool. One thing you notice are the Catholic sisters are all fair and happy unlike the other adults in the film, so at the end it rubs off on her. It never drags along, so the entire movie is kind of like a trailer. It's going to have mixed reviews probably because it's quick with the scenes."
AHHHHH I LOVE THIS MOVIE SO BAD
"Please if anyone know what’s the song Timothee
 played with the band in movie ??"
Please if anyone know what’s the song Timothee played with the band in movie ??
Lol I can tell she'll annoy me for a greater part of this movie
Well now I've seen it..too much trailer
Yuk...
LOVED THIS MOVIE
TWO BAD DECISIONS! I Really need to see this.
That girl didn't deserve that parents. really nice movie.
Thought this movie was about Dee
"This looks like such a fun, cute and sad movie all at the same time. Definitely gonna watch this."
"Just watched this yesterday- a beautiful coming-of-age story that'll make your heart clench, it's something everyone can relate to"
are nose bleeds a thing in every timothee chalamet film??
"I'm glad I watched this, because before I honestly thought this movie was about Lady Bird Johnson. But now that Timothee Chalamet is in it, I want to see it."
"I hate this character from the trailer alone. Why in God's name would I want to see an entire movie about such an annoying, obnoxious bitch?"
Every white girl indie movie is like this lol. Why does this have 99%on rotten tomatoes?? 😒
didnt get the point of it
This movie looks like shit
great film!
"This fucking movie hits soooo hard, damn, go watch it now!"
wtf is this shit?
looks gay AF
I want my life to have this color scheme omg
"I have no words about this incredible movie. I just have to thank my family a lot, for struggling for their life so I can have a better life . I LOVE THE MESSAGE"
Is this a film about Sheldon's sister??
fucking garbage
I’m here because of 💯 % rotten 🍅 review
Ok
"Although this looks like a good film, its weakness seems to be that Gary Oldman does not make any effort to make the speeches as Churchill made them. Churchill did not shout the speeches, he growled them. Also if you listen to the original ""We shall fight on the beaches "" speech, Churchill emphasised in each sentence the word ""fight"", and not the place where the fighting would take place, beaches etc. In his peroration, the emphasis was on the word ""never"" and not on the word ""surrender.

 Looks to me like American movie makers screwing up history again, and having Churchill make speeches sounding like a New Yorker."
"as for Oscars, sir Daniel day Lewis is in the house after 5 years."
"Not realistic, I can understand what Churchill is saying"
Need him now
Why the theme music is copied.
"This movie has dialogue, acting, and Nazi bastards. I must see this movie now"
"# This movie(DARKEST HOUR) and DUNKIRK fails to tell the truth about Churchill and his lying or his deliberate untruthfulness blaming the Belgian King and the Belgian army for the BEF’s defeat in 1940.
The BBC on THE GREAT LIE !
https://youtu.be/Py-bZ3XMHcI"
"As a huge fan of Winston Churchill, I hope that this movie will portrait him accurately. Will definitely come on my must-watch list movies in 2018"
Yes this man better get the oscar! I can’t wait to see this movie it’s going to be epic
Oh man I thought it was a new song from the band and got hyped.. and I probably won't ever watch this movie lol
it was our touch and glory time of human history. I wolud love to see this movie
"Hate this movie, oldman portrays Churchill for the most part as a bumbling old fart."
"I hope this movie explains why the British people at wars end voted Churchill out of office, the man who just saved all of their collective asses. And sent a greenhorn idiot to negotiate the spoils of war with Joseph Stalin who ran circles around his ass giving the Soviets far more of Europe than they could have dreamed of getting had Churchill still been in power. The American President was about as bad but it's not like we voted our President out at the end of the war, he unfortunately had died. 
PS. All of us in the states owe Obama a large amount of gratitude... If not for his ineptness and starting a fight with The Donald, we would have Jeb Bush or Hillary Clinton in the White House today."
"Hey studio! I SAID HEY STUDIO! Ive been looking forward to this movie, and I guess I live in too redneck of the Florida Town that I DONT GET TO SEE IT IN THE THEATERS???? Where's my movie. Churchill saved everybody's ass in the long run.....thats why all babies sort of look like him for a couple years. SEND ME THE MOVIE GARY OLDMAN ROCKS......send it over!!! please."
"Gary ""Oldman"" indeed. 
One of the best actors out there. 
Definitely gonna watch this movie!"
"This movie will come out tomorrow, Nov. 22, not in Jan."
Wow I cant wait for this movie!!!!
Be BALLS if this movie closes it's close... With this: https://youtu.be/Xg9aQvjMS60
How the fuck can this movie have a 5.8 in imdb and 82% on rotten tomatoes? Also all the reviews on imdb say its good.......
As a french i feel shamefull about how i like Winston Churchill and look forwrd to this movie
When I saw the title card that Gary Oldman is Winston Churchill my jaw dropped. This movie is going to be amazing
"""One man"". Yeah, that one f*cking man had help from Stalin, Roosevelt, and a bunch of other countries. All this movie will probably do is look at the good things he did, and ignore everything bad, and also ignore the help he received. Russian propoganda is bad, but British propoganda is worse."
I saw the series from PBS which showed Churchill debating on what to do during the early part of the war. I admire him very much and much more when he started correspondence with FDR they kept sending letters back and forth and FDR didn't want to get involved at that time. Eventually he provided aid by the time England needed more ships to hold their own against Germany. I was heart broken to see Churchill at a state so much pressure. One thing he was not going to back down to Hitler. He was not going to let Hitler walk through his country like France allowed Hitler! I can't wait to see this movie and Gary Oldman in his Best Actor Globe Award performance.
"Just saw this movie today. VERY WELL DONE. If you are expecting an action filled movie this movie is not for you though. Rather, it is a very in depth look at the personality and IMPORTANCE of Churchill in this time at the outbreak of WW2. In a time where many in Britain wanted to try appeasing to Germany, despite clear evidence it was folly, Churchill gave Britain the backbone it needed! And this is coming from someone who is 50-50 on Churchill. I take issue with some of the things he did in the 1920's with the Irish Revolution, but I have the utmost respect for his response to the threat of Hitler and he was most certainly the man they needed at that time!"
I watched this movie today it is a great movie and i encourage everyone to watch it
"Churchill will always divide opinions due to his actions in Ireland, India & at home as the result of the 1945 election proved but this movie is a snapshot of a moment in time . It will be for another to produce the definitive tale of the man, warts and all."
Just saw this movie... It was great !
I hope that this movie shows how churchill betrayd Poland. Pussyyy....
Time traveler from 2018 here. This movie rocks!
I love it best trailer ever I cried I'm in tears I'm seriously going to watch this movie I love history and I love war and oh my gosh I am so going to see this movie this summer
i have a feeling that this movie gonna be a great one.
Gary oldman look like real Winston churchil in this movie
"favorite movie.

no other has any chance to beat it.
This movie made me feel so patriotic, i even made a vid on his most famous speech."
This movie looks like Churchill besides this man was responsible for more than 3 million deaths in India alone why to glorify him..!!
Can’t believe they got Winston Churchill himself to do this movie
"#DarkestHour is the best movie. 
WATCH this movie here: [ nerdy.bid/DdhLK ]"
I think this movie wanted to say the PM had some pretty badass moments
fell asleep during this movie :(
So hitler is not in this movie? fuck y'all m not watching shit t'ill our leader is here
"Watch dunkirk first before this movie , trust me👍👍👍👍
Watching this first will spoil whats going to happen in dunkirk"
THis movie is no less fantasy than black panther . GOEBBELS STYLE PROPAGANDA
This movie was so boring OMFGGGGG
"I bet Hitler is the villain in this movie and the one who decleare war and start bombing campains and refuse every peace contract and imprison and later kill a man who try to make a peaceful is the hero.
Yeah kids, this is Hollywood !"
This is the most inaccurate historical account ever..Unless they show the genocide cause by churchill of million bengalis in India this movie is just a propaganda. He was as bad a criminal as hitler.
"This movie looks really powerful, great job"
Churchill was a bloody war criminal... this movie is a farce !
"Terrific film, outstanding acting but they should re-title this movie ""The Darkest Two Hours"". This film was shot entirely in low level lighting. I found it quite annoying. 
Anyone else thought it could have been a brighter lit set?"
Why in the hell the sound track of movie RUSH is being played in this movie...
No joke I actually geared up during this trailer and cried at the end of this movie when I saw it! Oldman for best actor!
This movie was so bad so disappointed expected some action no wonder it’s PG don’t watch this it’s all talking and only 1 sence of France getting bombed
Just heard he won an Oscar for this part and has also been nominated for a bafta too. Am most definitely going to watch this movie and this trailer has sold the film to me.
"forgive me i haven’t watch the movie but i will definitely the critics bash this movie because of Gary Oldman past remarked statement, enough his a good actor he apologies please"
OMFG
This looks bomb tbh
"Why is it a problem that Harry is an actor in this movie. I just dont get it. If there is a trailer released of any mcu movie i'm not like ""Oh my god i hope RDJ dies early in this movie"" what the fUck"
OMGOMGOMGOMGOMG I LOVE EVERY SINGLE OF THIS TRAILER. ESPECIALLY MY HARRY STYLES.
Wow
IM SHAKING
this movie gonna be crazyyyy!!!!! i love it!â¤
"The cast of this movie is off the wall - Mark Rylance, Tom Hardy, Kenneth Branagh, Cillian Murphy etc. Plus it's directed by Christopher Nolan!"
"harry: *turns around*
 me: king of acting give him an oscar
 
 no but honestly this movie looks really good"
This movie looks beautiful
This movie is going to be extremely emotional & Nolan's best till date...... #Vibes
"I really don't know what to say about this movie except PLEASE, PLEASE take all my money. Not sure if I got emotional over the movie or the fact that we are getting another Nolan film"
If Harry dies in this movie I will cry
This movie is going to be so good!
This movie and Paul Thomas Andersons new film with DDL are what I'm looking forward to see in 2017!
"Nolan uses the same cast for every movie ! Batman triology , Inception and now this movie !"
"MY BABE HARRYYYYðŸ˜ðŸ˜ 
 Really looking forward to see this movie ahh"
I think the name of the director is enough for this movie no trailer needed
I will watch this Movie because of Christopher Nolan not Harry Styles
i came here because of harry but this movie has a beautiful story behind. x
came here for Harry Styles but stayed because this movie looks awesome
OH GOD I CANT WAIT TO SEE THIS MOVIE ESPECIALLY HARRY AANDBSFNNF MY BABY ACTING ðŸ˜ðŸ˜ðŸ˜ðŸ˜
idk why but reminded me of titanic.I want this movie to get famous and stuff but i still want it to be my lil gem haha.I was waiting before harry annouced that he's gunna act in this and when i got even more pumped
THIS MOVIE LOOKS AMAZING. I'M SO EXCITED FOR A REALLY GOOD WAR MOVIE.
This movie looks amazing! Christoper Nolan is a genius. And I'm really excited to see harry's debute in cinema. I'm sure he's gonna do well and people who are not fan of him should give him a chance. Christopher Nolan chose him for a reason.
the only scum in this movie is harry focking styles
"I m gonna watch this movie all because of Nolan and Hans Zimmer..
 ."
This movie is gonna be sooo EPIC!! and I am not just saying that coz Harry is gonna be in it. Anything by Christopher Nolan is a masterpiece.
"the thing im most excited about this movie is the dogfight with Spitfires, bloody love them Spits"
"Whenever I watch a Nolan movie I can count on 3 things:
 1.- Hans Zimmer's awesome soundtrack
 2.- Cillian Murphy 
 3.- Michael Caine
 This movie delivers two out of three. 
 Fingers crossed for a Caine cameo at the end on the usual twist ending on which they show us scenes that we didnt analyze closely the first time around."
I'm gonna watch this trailer again and again until this movie gets out
i love christopher nolan movies. but why you dimmed the sun so much ? i hate that new trend in movies .. look at 0:14 where the fucking sun ? gonna watch this movie any ways but that triggered me
Omg!! I'm really looking forward to see this movie
Maaaaaaaaan i am so hyped for this movie <3 Nolan is the best director in this era <3 cant wait to see Cillian Murphy & Tom Hardy together again
"People should see this movie because it looks fucking epic and like a well made, well written movie by a great film maker. if you want to see it ONLY for Harry styles, and you have absolutely no interest in the movie or story at all, why see it?"
Action thriller? What is it? Die Hard 7? This movie should be about French and English generals-idiots which did not take seriously lessons from Polish defeat in September 1939 r. and did not find any counter tactics to Blitzkrieg. In May 1940 r. they did not use planes or tanks in sync with other type of units. English for example launched attack with Matildas only whose were destroyed by Erwin Rommel himself shooting to them from FLAK 88 guns whose should be destroyed by English infantry but Allied generals have different view how to use tanks. Dunkirk is a price for betraying Poland.
"I can't wait for this movie to come out. It looks so good, got chills just from watching the trailer!"
So gonna love this movie!
Who's harry styles ? I came to know only after this trailer and looking at comments... just one word is enough for me to watch this movie and that is 'Nolan'
1:41 to 2:00 My God look at that acting ! And by the way Gary Oldman should win the Oscar just because of this trailer alone.
I think I watched this trailer at least 60 times... :D The suggestion by music is marvellous... Gary Oldman is fucking incredible :O One of the best trailer ever made!
"My response to this trailer is simple. ""is that the real Winston Churchill?"". Just like when i am watching der Untergang with Bruno Ganz in it as Adolf Hitler."
They are using Rush soundtrack in this trailer
"And the music that makes this trailer so good is the same soundtrack s in the film ""RUSH""? Glad to ear it again."
"From this trailer alone, you can make a conclusion; that the difference between West and Natzi is that there are people in the so called democratic government who will always make you doubt the decision and the capacity of their leader, the cowards that question the decision of their leader, while in the East, no one would dare questioning Hitler's assessment. This also happens when Thatcher decided to go to war with Argentina. Even her own friends would question her decision."
Oldman should get an Oscar just for this trailer worth of material.
We Brits aren't known for our patriotism but damn this trailer makes me proud to be British!
"Can anyone help identify the music playing in this trailer? I know the last piece, which starts around 1:16 through the end is Hans Zimmer's ""Lost But Won"" from the film ""Rush"". But what are the two other pieces? I specifically mean the one that plays at the beginning, from about second 05 through 0:33, and the second piece of music that plays from about second 0:44 through about 1:12? Any guidance will be much appreciated! Thanks."
"Give Oldman the fucking Oscar just from this trailer, holy shit"
"This trailer is horrible, compared to the other one."
The movie is so much better than this trailer. And what about the soundtrack? It's like the Lannisters send their regards.
saw this trailer as ad in one video. one of the few movie ads I did't skip.
Did they used the Rains Of Castamere theme for this trailer?
I feel like I don't even need to see the movie after this trailer
This trailer alone invented photography.
"1:21 ""You have the full weight of the world in your shoulders"" (Lost but Won by Hans Zimmer beggins)...this trailer is perfection"
This trailer is actually so good that it gave me goosebumps xD
"went to go see Hidden Figures today and right when I entered the theater, I heard this trailer. I ran to the front bottom row and waited to see Harry styles. I was the only one applaused for the trailer and almost screamed. can't wait for the movie.â™¡â™¡â™¡â™¡"
honestly came to check out this trailer because of HARRY STYLES
"i may have come here for harry, but damn. after this trailer im sure as heck watching it for Christopher Nolan. im sold"
"people all saying that ""if Harry dies I'm going to scream in the theater"" it's about war so I have a lot of reasons why I need to watch this, cause

"went to go see Hidden Figures today and right when I entered the theater, I heard this trailer. I ran to the front bottom row and waited to see Harry styles. I was the only one applaused for the trailer and almost screamed. can't wait for the movie.â™¡â™¡â™¡â™¡"
honestly came to check out this trailer because of HARRY STYLES
"i may have come here for harry, but damn. after this trailer im sure as heck watching it for Christopher Nolan. im sold"
"people all saying that ""if Harry dies I'm going to scream in the theater"" it's about war so I have a lot of reasons why I need to watch this, cause

"Goddamnit this trailer changes themes way too fucking much, make up your goddamn mind"
i've watched this trailer like 4 times today
This trailer makes me extremely upset solely because I thought i was the only person who knew that song
Feel like I've seen the whole movie in this trailer. This is also an 'unspecial' movie .
is it just me or is the first scene in this trailer a straight lift from Crazy Stupid Love ?? Having said that I love Greta Gerwig :D
I loved that this trailer used a Monkees song. And they used an underrated Monkees song from their best album. Also the movie looks really good.
"I didn't watch it, but based on this trailer, I could say: Saoirse Ronan deserves best actress nomination"
"this trailer reminded me of the movie ""Broke Back Mountain"", i just know the ending is going to be a depressing sad one."
Every time I see this trailer or here the music it makes me cry it’s so beautiful and full of life I love this 😭❤️❤️
"i have watched this trailer like 10 times,,,today"
"The first trailer for the indie hit ""Call Me By Your Name"" was really well put together. It's hard to put a trailer together that really gives you the movie, without revealing everything about the movie. The lines that they include in the trailer are pivotal to the movie, but in full context in the movie, have so much more meaning. This is a beautiful movie. It will touch everyone, bringing you back to so many times of your life. From first love, to first heartbreak, to unrequited love, then full abandon. Mistakes, triumphs, and even a throwback to the 80s that depict joyful moments in your life. If you've ever been in love, or about to find love, with a man or a woman, this movie will speak to you. Shot in the breathtaking backdrop of Northern Italy, the performances are spot on - Luca Guadagnino drew out such intricate performances from every actor in this movie. Michael Stuhlbarg is the every father - you hope to have that kind of relationship, and he delivers some of the most touching and telling lines in this movie. - from describing the sculpture with undertones about relationships to the triumphant scene near the end that will have you in tears - he deserves an oscar for that performance. Who would not fall in love with Armie Hammer's Oliver in this movie, and who hasn't fallen in love someone who couldn't commit fully to you. Timothy Chalamet is stunning as Elio - baring all the emotions of every stage of love and heartbreak. Was this you at one time - I think everyone might relate to him at one point or another in this movie. Sufjan Stevens has three well placed songs in this movie, including ""Mystery of Love"", which is used in this trailer. The songs are perfect - Guadagnino had trouble securing him for this movie, but once he did, he gave him little direction beyond giving him the book and script, and all the songs were so good that listening to them even after the movie brings you right back to those scenes and those feelings. I think Guadagnino and James Ivory did justice to André Aciman's novel... and who knows, a sequel in a few years to finish off the book would be terrific if all these players come back. For me, the best picture this year. Go see this movie. It will be worth it."
This trailer is already sickening and I didn't even reach halfway through!!!! I can't even imagine how disturbing the movie is!!!
"This is the thirteenth time I'm watching this trailer, I'm not even joking at this point. I have read the book twice and I fucking love it. I can't wait to watch this movie, seriously. Today's the 24th, it releases in the U.S. today and I cannot fucking wait to watch it. Fingers crossed and tissues at the ready."
"Love this movie, but was disappointed the Monkees song , ""As We Go Along"" , heard in the final moments of this trailer, didn't make the final cut of the film. Perhaps it will show up in deleted scenes on the DVD?"
"This trailer just screams independent movie. I love Saoirse Ronan, and maybe the movie is great. It's obviously not meant to reach a wide audience, though. Annnnnd it could still be a total snore-fest coming-of-age/family dramedy... I will likely rent this in 6 months."
I see this trailer for so many times
"Mmmmm.... love me some Lucas Hedges -- the ""train tracks"" guy. He was the co-star in MANCHESTER BY THE SEA. Really glad to see Laurie Metcalf, the mom, she was Roseanne's sister Jackie in the TV sitcom. Saoriese Ronan usually does such serious projects, this looks fantastic and I can't hear a trace of her Irish accent. This trailer is a GRABBER!"
"I call this ""Girls"" The Hidden Lost Years"" This Trailer is a Riot! Could you see her going to St. Trinian's in The UK. She'd drive them up the wall because she showed no interest in anything."
"This trailer has literally brought me to tears, this is the first that a movie has related to me as a person, ever. I cant wait to see this absolute brilliant film. Its a shame this movie wasn't casting for someone of color, it would have been a privilege to play myself lol but its an honor to have someone like Saoirse Ronan to play such a part I think she will execute it beautifully, I can already tell that she has by this trailer alone. Once again looks like an absolute brilliant and beautiful film cant wait to see it."
This trailer is about a school called St. Francis. Its located in Sacramento. I went to this school and let me say that this story is so true and hits so close to home.
Baby Boomers will point to this trailer and say that the main actress is representative of all Millennials. And maybe she is. Sigh.
"relatable, i can't wait"
This looks really good!
What is the title of the song in this trailer?
"Soarise is great, but this trailer had me at Laurie Metcalf. She's brilliant in everything she does. Hope this film will generate some buzz so Laurie can finally get an Oscar nomination."
"God, I'm just watching the trailer over and over again... This was such an amazing flick, and the only thing I can binge on YouTube about it is this trailer and a five minute soundtrack preview. Please, help. I'm stuck."
"This trailer prompted me to see it after I saw it two days ago. 

I saw Lady Bird a few hrs. ago. It was good but not great. The acting was all good. As was the screenplay. The lead will likely get an Oscar nomination. A Golden Globe nomination for sure. 

Will likely get nominations for screenplay and direction. Deservedly so. The script is lean with no excess fat. The directing is economical and brisk.

I was really looking forward to Laurie Metcalfe. She was great on Roseanne. A scene stealer. In the movie she was like Jackie with a husband and a teenage daughter. Somewhat disappointing in that regard. I wouldn't be surprised if she gets nominated, too.

I hate the sexist term, but it's basically a ""chick flick. Women will most appreciate it. Probably Catholics, too. I'm a former 12 year- schooled Catholic, btw. I thought that part could have been a lot stronger.

Overall I give Lady Bird a 7/10.

A perfect score on RT? No way! Trolls or the studio are BSing people."
songs of this trailer please?
"I have not seen this movie, but based on reading the plot and watching this trailer it reminds me so much of the 1999 film ""Anywhere But Here,"" which stars Susan Sarandon and Natalie Portman."
Just watching this trailer made me white😂😂😂
this trailer convinced me it's a fortune I don't have any children.
I watched the whole movie via this trailer
This movie is fucking amazing
Go see this movie.
This was such an amazing movie
This movie was terrible.
Just saw it. It' tension from start to finish. It also show the chaos and horrors of war.
really lame movie...
Oscar candidate
"Nice movie, really enjoyed it and im quite critical usual"
1:31 song? please!
Why am I watching this trailer when I saw the movie yersterday?
Shit movie
"Brilliant movie, but not gonna lie -- I'm pretty disappointed that the music from the last 50 seconds of this trailer didn't make it in."
"There's something about this trailer that I cant put my finger on. It just feels so uninspriring.
 Given the scale of the real events it is meant to be portraying, it looks like its been filmed with basic secenery, a hand full of actors/extras, and it just feels to clinical and crisp! It doesn't feel like the production has any scale. Without mentioning the fact that its filmed with pretty boys that look just too clean throughout the whole trailer despite the hell they are supposed to be going through. 
 
 Not sure if that explains what I mean but you may get it. And it's just my oppinion. Nolan is a fantastic director but im feeling a bit underwhelmed by this trailer."
It was very good film
Movie sucked
i love WW2 Movies
This film is so much more than the trailer! Gives a real sense of the beauty Nolan can create. Give my review on my channel a look to see why it was so great. FFx
Amazing Film :') <3
Half of the people watching this trailer don't even know who Hitler was thanks to Harry Styles being in it.
I watch this trailer 13 times in 3 days
So glad this trailer has more views than the fucking Despicable Me 3 trailer
"Most of the people even watching this trailer are just in it for Harry Styles, probably don't even know a thing about WW2..."
who is harry styles now..???? all i know is it Christopher Nolan and Dunkirk.
"imo Saving Private Ryan and Band of Brothers kinda set the bat kinda high when it comes to making me feel like i am in the middle of combat...i didn't get that adrenaline from this trailer or the 1st one they put out, <mind you this film has high caliber actors in it, but the action or what transforms me into is not there...just saying lets see when its finally out. 
 
 If you share my views THUMBS UP"
Is it weird that Kenneth Branagh was the most exciting actor to me in this trailer?
You know what? I know who Harry Styles is but I don't know what he looks like. I don't know who he is in this trailer. I don't care. Bring it.
They may as well play the glitch mob - seven nation army remix on this trailer.
i love a good war movie but i didnt like this trailer..didnt get me excited to see this at all..the first teaser was good..this was meh
where was harry styles in this trailer? i never saw him
Christopher Nolan could have done more with this movie . This trailer wasn't as exciting as his other movies.
am i the only one who didn't realise that the faggot from 1D wasn't in this trailer.. too busy watching Cillian Murphy a very good actor... well act.
i see again a bad extra in this trailer i think. when the sand explosion begins you see one guy walking en slowly falling
Low key only watching this trailer cause Harry's in it
"The footage is really good, but the pacing of this trailer is really all over the place."
"I've already seen this trailer a thousand times but if Harry actually dies in this movie I'd like to have a ""chat"" with whoever helped make the scene where he does"
Not a single woman in this trailer â™¡ #fuckfemenism
"Wanna know what the most awesome aspect of this trailer is? There is no CGI in it, not at all. Everything you see is practical."
This trailer exploded. From 1m to 6m in 2 days.
I don't remember what this trailer is about because I kept asking myself if that was the guy from one direction.
"If y'all are really saying that just because Harry is in this movie, he ruined it all, grow up. If you don't like him just because he is in One Direction, that doesn't mean you gotta start trashing him and the movie that you haven't even seen yet. This trailer is so cool and the movie looks like it's going to be amazing. Harry being in this movie is actually going to promote it like crazy, which is actually a good thing because people should learn about the history of Dunkirk. And for all we know, Harry could do an amazing job in Dunkirk ! Don't judge the whole movie just because he is in it. Personally, I'm so excited to see it in July !"
"Let's clarify something, a lot of ppl r seeing this movie bc of Harry styles and he's only in this trailer for a few seconds"
"Wow, not a single woman in this trailer? I guess that makes another sexist misogynist Hollywood film."
"For those saying it's ""ruined"" because Harry makes an appearance in it... he didn't even say anything in this trailer and what's going around is that he has a small role anyhow. 
 
 Give the movie / Styles a chance, especially when all you've seen is a 2 minute and 18 second trailer as well as a few photos."
"Damn, the way Tom Hardy is revealed in this trailer is freaking amazing."
"Never know what you're gonna get with Nolan, this trailer shows nothing much by way of how the film will work structurally, who will it follow as the protagonist? Or will it cut in between all the characters, Murphy, Rylance, Branagh, Hardy, Styles?? I don't know."
Can we put aside Harry Styles for a minute and praise how beautiful this trailer is?
this trailer legit gave me chills
I watch this trailer and i think of battle field 1
Hey guys if you want to see a reaction to this trailer i just posted one. Check it out!
"Yes, show the gruesome event known as dunkirk, without showing the gruesomeness..... it's not even blood anywhere in this trailer. I guess every soldier was made from cotton.... I will pass thnak you, I don't feel like watching a historic event with 10-year olds screaming in my ear every time that OD kid is on the screen."
Anybody got that Kubrick vibe watching this trailer?
"This trailer gets me... But im not sure if i should watch it, cuz i get enotional very easily."
this trailer just grabbed me by the pussy and I dunno if I liked it
this trailer just grabbed me by the pussy and I dunno if I liked it
"First shot of this trailer and you instantly know this movie is from Nolan without knowing it in the first place. Absolutely mesmerizing. Christopher creates art in it's purest form.
 And Hans Zimmer for the soundtrack... my god. I just can't... Nolan + Zimmer = Perfection. 
 
 We need a shippingname for those two - something like Zilon or Nommer.
 
 2017 is going to be an overwhelmingly good year in theaters."



"Many of you guys seem to not like this trailer because there isn't a lot of explosions and bullets whizzing past people's skulls but I'm going to give you guys a history lesson. Dunkirk for one isn't necessarily a battle but a failed retreat in the early stages of the war. 400,000 British troops being surround in a France port and no where to go because the Germans have them surrounded by all sides; hence the papers falling from the sky dropped by the Germans letting the British know they are surrounded. Many troops have committed suicide in the this tragedy because with Germans tanks, infantry and Ships the British knew they had no chance for victory. A lot of them have tried swimming though to the nearest UK island which is why the soldier took his head off and started swimming off."
"I have been a fan of Christopher Nolan's movies since the very beginning and this trailer just made me excited all over again. This is going to be such a great movie (I love history based movies lol)
 And Heyyyy, I wouldnt want to not comment about how Harry Styles is in this movie. Im so excited and proud for him, he has worked hard, So if people in the comments would stop thinking about harry as a boy band member (where also he works hard) and appreciate his work as an actor in this movie, it would be really nice of them. 
 
 Cant wait for 2017 July. Great Job Christopher and the rest of the involved people :)"
"Not only am I super hyped for this movie because its a war movie directed by Christopher Nolan, but am I the only one who thought that the theme towards the end of this trailer resembled Battlefield 4s best theme called ""A Theme For Kjell""? Holy sh*t I'm even more hyped to see this now, gonna be a very emotional ride it seems! :D"
Harry Styles didn't appear much in this trailer. That's a good sign.
so this trailer is #1 on trending because of harry styles? lool
did you guys see john cena in this trailer? no? well you only think about harry.
That one direction guy is more than lucky for getting his first acting debut in a Chris Nolan's movie..But i hope he wont ruine this movie.I have been waiting for a Nolan movie since 2014.
"For me it depends how you answer this question, would you have seen this movie even if Harry Styles wasn't in it? if yes then that's great but if you're one reason for seeing this is because of him then fuck off, that shows great disrespect to everyone else who worked on this film and all of the actual soldiers who were there."
"Although I think it's awesome that Harry is in this movie, proud of him, it isn't the main reason I want to watch it. This is a historical event we should learn and know about, Christopher Nolan is an amazing director, not to mention Tom Hardy and Cillian Murphy are part of the cast. I am so excited! So yeah a lot of people are here for Harry, doesn't mean you should rain on their parade, they're happy and proud of him. You wouldn't want to be bashed at for seeing your idol in a movie would you?"
they better show the french sacrifice at Dunkirk.. or this movie will loose instant credibility for me
Tom Hardy's in this movie?? I gotta see it
I will suck whoever's cock to what this movie ya
Half of the earnings of this movie will be all because of the Directioners.
0:47
"i'm pretty sure every ""harry styles hater"" will become his diehard fan after this movie! <3"
"I think it's unfair how people are acting towards One Direction fans. I am one myself, and yes, I want to see this movie because of Harry. But that doesn't mean I'm just an intelligent little teenage girl who only cares about hot guys. You can't judge an entire fanbase because of how a portion of them are. Some of you all need to lay off on the fans, it's not a crime to like a band."
This movie is gonna be a FUCKING blockbuster bc of HARRY
This movie is going to be superb.
CAN'T WAIT. looks great....I want to see the air to air dogfighting...
Battlefield 2 looks amazing
Another world war 2 movie
"When you like and know Christopher Nolan, Harry Styles, and the history of Dunkirk so none of the comments bother you. aND THIS MOVIE LOOKS FUCKING EPIC."
"Stop criticising @harryStyles, we have not watched his performance yet. This movie will be an epic just like the other movies of Nolan, he is a wise man and takes good decisions. So stop disliking and passing rude comments, and support this movie if you want to. #StopBeingJudgemental."
"One direction fans, I am one myself I am only seeing this movie because harry styles is in itðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚"
"To everyone saying that directioners shouldnt spoil the movie by concentrating on harry and just basically telling us that we're all shallow dumbasses and should shut up: 
 1) Us being excited about harry is just like a fan of leo dicaprio being excited about him. Why does it suddenly hurt you? 
 2) Please don't judge his acting skills before actually watching this movie. If he's bad, then im sure most of us will accept it and laugh it off and be proud of him for even trying.
 3) Why is it that if we're excited about harry, we cant possibly be excited about the movie itself? why do you think we wont be able to appreciate Christopher Nolan or the historic value in this? 
 4) Why does it matter to you? If there's anyone it should matter to, its the rest of the cast and film people. And you know what? Im sure they're fine with us being excited about him because im sure they know he's a great guy and at the end if the day, all it means, is more money for them. 
 
 So please just stop being killjoys and haters and just go about your own business. I hope you realise that you're arguing with 13-25 year olds. I hope you realise that its them that you're calling dumb and its them that youre asking to kill themselves. I hope you realise that at the end of the day, you just manage to come off as narrow minded and immature."
I'm happy and angry!
1:52 Harry dead
How does nolan forget christian bale for this movie????
"BORING AF
 release the Justice League Trailer"
"And here comes another round of 1D fans having to explain all the other reasons they have to see this movie other than Harry's face because really, how could our atrophied brains appreciate an actual great cinematographic experience when you know... HIS HAIR?!?"
If Harry dies in this movie I'll give a standing ovation in that damn theater as soon as it happens.
Good
"finally, another movie that fits his agenda."
i am sure no other movie can match this!!!! just give Nolan the goddamn Oscar already!!!
Holy Christopher Nolan. This is Oscar material.
One Oscar Parcel!!!
Chris Nolan is all set for the Oscars.
And the Oscar for Best Directing goes to...... CN
"*facepalm after reading some comments like ""Harry will get an Oscar/will be nominated for Oscar "". Bitch calm your titties down its his first damn fucking movie."
"well other movie about war, with different director, what original, this movie sure win the oscar"
"If this movie does good, based off a true story, and if Harry has great acting. He can easily win an Oscar for sure"
I'm very surprised this is being released during the summer because it could easily be an Oscar contender if the movie is as good as it looks..
"Omg! Harry is so talented .. Give him an Oscar , give him my ass also so he can bang me . Gay motherfucker."
THEI BETTER WIN AN OSCAR
"Summer 2017 damn along time , I guess they'll have to wait for the 2018 Oscar to get nominated ."
"And here come the Nolan-tards saying this is ""Oscar worthy"" Lmao 
 
 back under your bridges dusty bums ;)"
Harry = OSCAR for supporting actor !
I hope Harry wins an Oscar in 2018
"""E o prÃ³ximo oscar vai para..... Harry Styles!!!!!"" kkkkkkk ðŸ˜ðŸ˜ðŸ˜ðŸ˜ðŸ˜ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ Eu estou muito orgulhosa do nosso Hazza. Acho q todos os directioners estÃ£o tambÃ©m. â¤"
Oh yea
wow
and Oscars goes to... 
And the Oscar for Best Picture goes to..
"gay, since his always getting fucked in the ass by Oscars."
"Everything looks so clear - good rhythm, intense atmosphere and an interesting story. I feel an oscar nomination coming :-)"
